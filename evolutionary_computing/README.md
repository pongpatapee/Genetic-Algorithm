# Genetic Algorithms

## How it works

For "evolution" to occur in code as it does in nature, we need 3 main elements to be present

1. **Heredity**: There must be a way for _parents_ of one generation to pass
   on their traits to the next

2. **Variation**: There must be enough variation in a population and a way to introduce variation

3. **Selection**: There must be a mechanism in which some creatures have the opportunity to
   pass down their genes while others don't
